4800000:Channel guys or when I've been off the stage and struggling and at the mercy of anxiety and depression  or when I feel like I'm under the sun 
4960000:this pernicious a pervasive demon known as an adequacy that so many of us are fighting  cheap gently nuts before word right 
5120000:the moment when I felt like giving up  so I'm a musician today not only because of what she gave up for me but also because of what she can
